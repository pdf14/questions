## Abstract 

Government IT projects tend to be heavyweight, resource intensive, and typically provide stakeholders — both inside and outside the agency firewall — with little day-to-day visibility into a project's goals or status, let alone the opportunity to contribute or support its success. Today, government agencies at all levels of government are increasingly looking to the open source community's workflows and philosophies to sustain citizens' demands for better government data, more user-centric constituent services, and more collaborative policymaking. During this session, by looking at democracy from a product, process, and people perspective, speakers from the private sector, White House, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will explore how more open and efficient communication across both sides of the firewall can empower bureaucrats and civic hackers alike to help build a more collaborative democracy.
